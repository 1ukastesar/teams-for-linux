# Notifications (Deprecated)

This folder has the code that handles the desktop notifications hack implementation.

There only the [index.js](index.js) file. The desktop notification is a temporary solution that will be hopefully face out as linux clients start implementing its support.

At the time of writing, Ubuntu 18 does support the notications so it has been deem necessary to disable this hack.
